In 2023 6b6t rose to its peak of an avarage playercount of 90, sometimes even 100+. There were alot of ikea dupes, which started with the IKEAv1 dupe that released upon ikea's launch with their most powerfull dupe from may 10th to the end of april called IKEAv5. As the year passed the playercount kept getting better with June as the absolute peak. after the summer holidays were over it kept getting worse for 6b. However [qbasty](../Users/qbasty.md) kept his server alive by hosting the occasional event with the most notable being the christmas quests in December.
