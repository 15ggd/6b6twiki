During this year the COVID-19 pandemic started. In April-May the premium server was shut down, only the cracked server remained online.

Then, YouTuber [MrCramYT](https://www.youtube.com/@MrCramYT) livestreamed on the server which gained about 60 players. He later uploaded a now deleted video about it in June. This then motivated Leee to continue working on the cracked server and shut down the premium server after a hard drive failure.

During the summer and winter of this year the server gained alot of players.
