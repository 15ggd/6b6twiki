> 6b6t is for sale. I have been thinking about this for a while and it's time for me to work on something else. I've been running anarchy servers since 2021. I have still many great ideas to take this server to thousands of players and long lifetime so it doesn't shut down, but I believe I'm not gonna be the one to take it there. I would love to help someone take the server there by still being involved few days per month. Please DM me with your offers, I won't give you the price so just tell me your best price at the start, be serious, I'm sure I'll receive **a lot** of requests, 6b6t is not only the biggest anarchy server in the world, it's also the one that generates the most revenue after 2b2t (not profit, because we reinvest everything and put in additionally our own money, it's possible for the server to be profitable but we chose growth and updates instead of profit). I'll sell the server to the person that not offers just the most, but is also the best person to take over. My DMs at <\@1192360689411575828> are open. I'll make sure the server continues running and you can still have fun, so no worries. ‚ù§Ô∏è üëë Have a nice day everyone. @everyone <\@&1051075005250809966>

basically he meant that the costs of 6b6t were starting to overcome why he still did it he did not want to ruin 6b6t and thus kept the minecraft server up this decision here "saved" 6b6t for the past 2 months
