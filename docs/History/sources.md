[8b8t.me wiki - The 6b6t era](https://wiki.8b8t.me/index.php?title=History#:~:text=6b6t.org%20/%206b6t.co%20Era%20(March%202019%20to%20January%202021),-The%206b6t%20era)

# Original (Discord) messages on 6b6t wiki's server
# DSNS's version
According to the website, `6b6t` was created in 2022 but according to DSNS it was created atleast before July 2019 time during wich Leeewith3Es was the owner and DSNS joined, proof is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaW-yZpxiqk) youtube AD released July 18th 2019. The server was kinda active, nowhere near the player count it is today.
There was a bunch of admin abuse, `thetroll2001` had OP perms
The `6b6t` domain was actually taken from leee without his permission.
He explained it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQfO_RxcHxI), leee went on to create `6b6t.co`.
DSNS quit the server for a while so someone needs to fill in the info after leee sold it.
And it seems to this day he doesn't like qbasty or `6b6t`.
I also think that qbasty reset the server/world jan 16, 2022, the day it started (according to the website)

# Original text by DSNS (Discord: dsns)
- i can try to fill you guys with information about 6b
- the first thing is that the current `6b6t` website is lying, `6b6t` is much older than 2022, it was actually created at least before july 2019.

- i believe Leeewith3E was the owner during 2019, when i first joined the server
- he released an ad for `6b6t` july 18 2019 on his channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaW-yZpxiqk

- the server was kinda active, nowhere near the player count it is today

- ofc take his word with a grain of salt
- actually here is a description by lee himself https://wiki.8b8t.me/index.php?title=History#:~:text=6b6t.org%20/%206b6t.co%20Era%20(March%202019%20to%20January%202021),-The%206b6t%20era  

### North later replied to the second message
- <ins>North</ins>: leee made the server because someone else bought 0b0t after the domain expired, after that it was passed to bleepo in 2020
- <ins>DSNS</ins>: yea the wiki post i linked has pretty much everything
- <ins>North</ins>: oldfag had stuff to do with 6b as well https://oldfagdotorg.fandom.com/wiki/6b6t.org
- <ins>North</ins>: I think I still have a world download of spawn from 2020 6b

firey's discord: `hi.im.firy.if.u.read.dis.u.cool`

it all started when qb abandoned oa and said 6b would surpass 2b by miles
it did get alot of players it kept a steady 100-150 playerbase for a while then theres this two cool guys called normal cat and cipher
cat was a previous owner of 6b
and cipher was an admin
when the server got reworked both of them got backstabbed by qb by stripping them of their roles
then they tried to expose this admin on 6b called hop for being a pedophile
and pistonmaster stepped in and defended the so called pedophile
so cipher called piston out also for defending a literal pedo
both got banned and they made a server
in discord
to talk about gathering evidence to expose 6b cause at that time
qb was talking to a guy
and said he would give him money to get 6b botted
but in the end qb never paid so the guy stopped botting and started to join cipher and cat
also the downfall of 6b was also caused by retarded decisions
also there was this one time 6b went below 0.1 tps and it got so unplayable
chat started to get spammed like crazy
they made it so you can pay for higher dupe chances
and like that was really not cool so the community started to get mad cause its p2w
but qb did eventually revert the changes
after cipher and cat broke off 6b qb hired randos like ollie and nixter17
he got later doxxed by thetroll2001  and left `6b6t` because he admin abused 
didnt ollie leave 6b cause he wasnt being paid
by qb and he got tired of his shit
that and because also what happened with nixter
