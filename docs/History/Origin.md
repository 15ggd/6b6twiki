`6b6t` was born in March of `2019`. During its early stages, it had a small player base ranging from 5-20 players at times and would sometimes get over 30 players.

The server at the time was also premium and not cracked like it is today. During this time, Leee and 0b0t's players and staff had much conflict, such as `0b0t` players joining `6b6t` to crash, lag or bot the server. This conflict would go on until June of `2020`. `6b6t` was a premium server until Leee launched a cracked server sometime in late `2019` under the subdomain `cracked.6b6t.org`.

The cracked server did not get many players as most people would play on the premium server `6b6t.org`.
Not a lot happened for `6b6t` during 2019 as `6b6t` was just starting out it was not until 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic where `6b6t` drastically changed.

In April-May 2020, the Premium server was shutdown so it became a completely cracked server. Sometime in April 2020 during the COVID-19 world pandemic, YouTuber [MrCramYT](https://www.youtube.com/@MrCramYT) livestreamed on `6b6t` and the server gained about 60 players. He later uploaded a now deleted video about `6b6t` in June of 2020. This then motivated Leee to continue working on the cracked server and shut down the premium server after a hard drive failure. During the summer and winter of 2020 `6b6t` gained alot of players.

The map was reset multiple times in 2019.
Then in November (of 2019) the main IP became cracked.6b6t.org then later Leee was able to recover the premium map and both servers split again.

The last time it reset was before its shutdown and sale in January of 2021 when 6b6t was backdoored and ratted. This resulted in Leee having to reset the server (the server files were kept on an external hard drive) in order to resolve the issue. While resetting the server the backup got corrupted which caused Leee to reset the map for the final time until 6b6t shutdown and the domain was sold but no server files were publicly given.
This map was then used when the server relaunched as 7b7t.me and is still the same map that is being used today on 8b8t.

# DSNS's version
According to the website, `6b6t` was created in 2022 but according to DSNS it was created atleast before July 2019 time during wich Leeewith3Es was the owner and DSNS joined, proof is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaW-yZpxiqk) youtube AD released July 18th 2019. The server was kinda active, nowhere near the player count it is today.
There was a bunch of admin abuse, `thetroll2001` had OP perms
The `6b6t` domain was actually taken from leee without his permission.
He explained it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQfO_RxcHxI), leee went on to create `6b6t.co`.
DSNS quit the server for a while so someone needs to fill in the info after leee sold it.
And it seems to this day he doesn't like qbasty or `6b6t`.
I also think that qbasty reset the server/world jan 16, 2022, the day it started (according to the website)

- i can try to fill you guys with information about 6b
- the first thing is that the current `6b6t` website is lying, `6b6t` is much older than 2022, it was actually created at least before july 2019.

- i believe Leeewith3E was the owner during 2019, when i first joined the server
- he released an ad for `6b6t` july 18 2019 on his channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaW-yZpxiqk

- ofc take his word with a grain of salt
- actually here is a description by lee himself https://wiki.8b8t.me/index.php?title=History#:~:text=6b6t.org%20/%206b6t.co%20Era%20(March%202019%20to%20January%202021),-The%206b6t%20era  

### North later replied to the second message
- <ins>North</ins>: leee made the server because someone else bought 0b0t after the domain expired, after that it was passed to bleepo in 2020
- <ins>DSNS</ins>: yea the wiki post i linked has pretty much everything
- <ins>North</ins>: oldfag had stuff to do with 6b as well https://oldfagdotorg.fandom.com/wiki/6b6t.org
- <ins>North</ins>: I think I still have a world download of spawn from 2020 6b

it all started when qb abandoned oa and said 6b would surpass 2b by miles
it did get alot of players it kept a steady 100-150 playerbase for a while then theres this two cool guys called normal cat and cipher
cat was a previous owner of 6b
and cipher was an admin
when the server got reworked both of them got backstabbed by qb by stripping them of their roles
then they tried to expose this admin on 6b called hop for being a pedophile
and pistonmaster stepped in and defended the so called pedophile
so cipher called piston out also for defending a literal pedo
both got banned and they made a server
in discord
to talk about gathering evidence to expose 6b cause at that time
qb was talking to a guy
and said he would give him money to get 6b botted
but in the end qb never paid so the guy stopped botting and started to join cipher and cat
also the downfall of 6b was also caused by retarded decisions
also there was this one time 6b went below 0.1 tps and it got so unplayable
chat started to get spammed like crazy
they made it so you can pay for higher dupe chances
and like that was really not cool so the community started to get mad cause its p2w
but qb did eventually revert the changes
after cipher and cat broke off 6b qb hired randos like ollie and nixter17
he got later doxxed by thetroll2001  and left `6b6t` because he admin abused 
didnt ollie leave 6b cause he wasnt being paid
by qb and he got tired of his shit
that and because also what happened with nixter
